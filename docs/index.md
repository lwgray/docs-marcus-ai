## What is Marcus AI?

Marcus AI is an intelligent agent coordination platform that enables autonomous software development through:

- **ðŸ§  Cognitive Memory System**: Multi-tier memory architecture that learns from every project
- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Task Assignment**: Intelligent matching of tasks to agent capabilities
- **ðŸ“Š Real-time Visualization**: Monitor agent activity with the Seneca dashboard
- **ðŸ”„ Continuous Learning**: Agents improve performance through pattern recognition

## For Different Users

### Developers
Build software faster with AI agents that handle routine tasks while you focus on architecture and design.

```python
# Create a new AI-powered project
marcus create e-commerce-platform
marcus start

# Monitor with Seneca
seneca start --auto-discover
```

### Teams
Scale your development capacity with AI agents that learn from your workflows and adapt to your patterns.

```bash
# Register specialized agents
marcus agent register --role backend
marcus agent register --role frontend

# Agents coordinate automatically
marcus project status
```

### Researchers
Study AI agent coordination, emergent behaviors, and collective intelligence in software development contexts.

```python
from marcus import MemorySystem

memory = MemorySystem()
patterns = memory.analyze_patterns()
predictions = memory.predict_outcomes()
```
